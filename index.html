         <p>
             I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Ministry and Leadership with a Spanish minor.
        </p>
         <p>
            I currently attend Gateway Baptist Chruch in Travelers Rest in South Carolina. I love the congregation there, and we have cultured a magnificent college group that loves to serve the Lord.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I love to longboard and enjoy God's creation. Another thing that I use my liberty in is going on drives. I truly enjoy just taking my car and riding down the long road. 
         </p>

        This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayes observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
